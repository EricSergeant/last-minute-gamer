## Abstract
Are you running a Dungeons & Dragons game and don't have a creature for your players to encounter? Find A Monster will solve your problem. This application provides a quick way to select monsters for your game by Challenge Level, meaning they're the right difficulty for your players.

`` "This project will challenge you to use the technology youâ€™ve become familiar with over the course of Mod 3, as well as force you to work inside some constraints...this project, having a short time frame, will need to pack a lot into a small space." ``

## Wins
### Completed Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- All product requirements were completed for this project, even under a shortened timeframe.

### Completed Additional Project Extension

- In addition to completing the MVP, I was able to complete an additional project extension by adding the ability for users to add and track favorite creatures.  This includes functionality to link back to the creature from the favorites menu, as well safegaurds that the same creature isn't added more than once to the favorites.

## Challenges and Improvements
### Timeline

- Designing and implementing an app in a quick 6 day sprint was challenging, but it demonstrates the amount of learning we've done over the past few weeks that this  can be completed.

### Additional features

- Future improvements could include a login functionality, as well as addition adds such as treature-finder.
